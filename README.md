# 🍽️ University Cafe System

A simple yet powerful touch-based cafeteria ordering system designed for university campuses. Students can view available items for **lunch**, **dinner**, or **snacks**, add them to their cart, and place an order — all with just a few taps. The system is fully backed by a dynamic backend, allowing staff/admins to update the menu at any time without restarting the app.
